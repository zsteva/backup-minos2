soundsystem is already nicely split between wavein and waveout, each loaded from
the correct mixer.
At present it starts up either in input (to a file) or output(from a file or a 
prebuilt set of samples such as tone/twotone/pip/CW)
We need to add a new "mode" to be used in idle/passthrough state

I need to find the state diagram and work out how to extend it...

Split sound into 2 - mic in/record and mic out/playback sbDriver is a singleton
and contains a pointer to soundsystem
This currently limits it to a single soundcard, and Vista and up split cards into 2
Could do with changing to smart pointers everywhere
If we use a shared_ptr for soundsystem from sbdriver we may be able to use very
similar code?
