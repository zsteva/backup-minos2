Refactor of calendar to stop need for annual update
Add exit button to about fialog
==================================================================
1.5.7      - bug fix release

Sort the duplicate logging problkem of M0GHZ and others
==================================================================
1.5.6
2013 calendar
M6 multiplier
==================================================================
1.5.5 - bug fix release
Some complaints of screen "going mad" when editting QSOs
QSO Edit dialog and tabbing improved
No edit menu when on QSO grid
==================================================================
1.5.4
- Font selection and scaling; Support of large screen fonts; hence some layouts re-arranged. Look at Tools|Select Font.

Fonts selection works mostly; I know that menus are still in the system defined font, as are some "standard" dialogs. If you use this, let me know where I've missed it.

Font selection has also lead to some layout changes to make it work properly.

- Long(unlimited)) CSL list lines accepted

- Signal Report autofill made optional, and initially defaulted to "off"; look on "Tools" menu to re-enable it

- Force date format; now works on machines with non-UK date/time formats (but still uses UK formats on display)

- MinosLogger.ini exposed under file|options; in particular exposes default log and lists paths.
MinosLogger.ini (File|Options) is rather "raw", and not very friendly.

- Click on a country in the multiplier display and the matches will display all the QSOs with that country, under whatever prefix (e.g. click on G for G, M, 2E, etc).

- Antenna bearing offset in station bundle; has O suffix in QSO frame (e.g. 60degOT); no suffix on bearing in lists.

- Improved transfer of operator callsigns to the entry file

- Improved editing of entry file details and settings

minor bug fixes : 
  scrolling of QSOs in catch-up
  propogation of CW across multiple QSOs
  numerics not allowed in callsign body
  Must be a numeric portion in call (2LO becomes illegal!)
  match xfer from a list now transfers exchange as well if present
==================================================================
1.5.3 (only released privately as a Beta)

Force date format; now works on machines with non-UK date/time formats (but still uses UK formats on display)

MinosLogger.ini exposed under file|options; in particular exposes default
log and lists paths.

Click on a country in the multiplier display and the matches will display
all the QSOs with that country, under whatever prefix (e.g. click
on G for G, M, 2E, etc).
                                
Antenna bearing offset in station bundle; has O suffix in QSO frame (e.g. 60degOT); no suffix on bearing in lists.
==================================================================

Bug fix release:

Point/QSO mode now shows correctly on status line
Date/time on catch up
Occasional not logging the date/time of a QSO
==================================================================
V1.5.1

No DTG on add before/after (use the dtg from the reference contact?)
Double click on date in edit doesn't turn off RO

G6HNUs problem - how did he get M1MHZ with no DTG?

Maybe the comparative stats if it works well enough - otherwise we may need to branch
==================================================================
V1.5 Release notes

2011 calendar

Prettification of bundles
Operator combos are now larger
Add next/prior, but no consequential bulk changes
Catchup and serial numbers - bug fix
Archive display - bug fix
HF style prefix handling, should improve recognition of odd prefixes
===========================================================================
1.4 release notes

Read only now becomes "protected" and is stored properly with the contest. It can be temporarily lifted so that back editting can be done. For now, you have to set it manually; I may in future make it automatically set on producing the entry or after the entry date has passed. What do the users think?

Tab highlighting is more prominent with tab colours - a darkish blue for normal contests, darkish green for protected contests, bright green for protected contests that are temporarily unprotected, bright blue for the current contest

Operator setting moved from ops frame to main screen or contest details screen, and I hope it all works again.

Sticky "show operators" on Right Mouse Button for main screen

Station call is the default initial operator

Dble click on QSO in "other" grid does transfer, not edit; Right Mouse Button option for editting "other" grid contact

Post event and unfilled QSO simplification - catch-up button and unfilled button on QSO edit area.

Scrolling tabs as an option, on Right Mouse Button. This makes all the tabs form a single line at the top, with scroll arrows, rather than multiple lines.

New printable output format on Produce Entry/export file

EDI export entry keeps the file name - robot will sort it out if not to standards.

Bug fixes

//================================================================
Next version - 1.3.0 - new features etc

1.3.0.165

Duplicate bug when coming off the QSO Edit dialog

Uses rsgbcc URL for contest files

"time now" button/accelerator

"mode change" button/accelerator

Revise display of current band; above cribsheet looks good;

Locators - if replacing 1/I and 0/O makes a good locator then do it!

Mults don't get reset when choosing from calendar

New style splitters, all should be sticky

New style calendar

Reduced number of support files (so hopefully all smaller)
