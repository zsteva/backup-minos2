If I use 'export printable' in Minos (pre V2) I get all the columns, 
going left to right, up to 'bearing' but not the next one 'distance'. 
Does anyone know if there is a way to add the distance column to the 
printable file?
//=============================================================================
Still to do from Ken's points

idealWidth of HTML fields - 1.7 mult is a bodge
Double click column sizing on UTC column with no data - can I make sure SOMETHING shows?

setup and log directory
[Ken >>>] For the destination location I set U:\Minos2 and would expect the
logs directory to then default to U:\Minos2\Logs, but instead I get
C:\Minos\Logs
 
Run on multiple screens; dialog to folow parents screen?

Mike,

This is my complete list, some of which may duplicate previous messages. I
thought it better to get them all in one place.

Ken
 

.          Callsign and locator width and comments in log NOT fixed for
certain paranoid combinations. Try DD8DDD/MM with locator DD88DD (in bold
for first contact)

[mjg] sizeHint in HtmlDelegate is giving what is used as the size, but it is wrong
trying mult by 1.7 - or is this something to do with highres screen?

.          Edit QSO, Catch-up (Post Entry), and top right of Data entry all
have the same problem. This data is displayed in the correct order, but the
labels for the fields are still in the wrong order. All three could do with
some repositioning of the fields/data for clarity.

[mjg]ordering done; asked Ken for more on repositioning.

.          If the installation selects a non-standard directory, logs
default back to C: rather than sub-folder of selected directory

[mjg] I had told inno "don't overwrite" INI key!


.          If in catch-up cannot select an entry from CSL panel

[mjg] look at this again! Why not have this match/other match/archive match? But need 
to stop signals being acted on by main QSO area. 

.          No error message if try to re-open a file that no longer there.
(Unchanged from V1.early, is it intentional?)

[mjg] Asked Ken if this really matters 

.          Bottom left panel, comments does not have a right sidebar.

[mjg] stretch last column - just not visible but it is there and works.

.          Change font initially screws up locator stats display, restart
required for it to reset.


.          Font size increase compounds the column sizing issues of course

[mjg] Font changing now works (style sheets)

.          Programme needs restart to see Station.ini (Entry and QTH are
seen without restarting)

[mjg] fixed

.          File/Options shows  Autofill as  false initially; set autofill
changes it to 1, clear autofill then resets it to 0.

[mjg] fixed - now starts as 0

.          Edit of Entry and QTH does not force upper case; appears as upper
case in the details. If contest details manually entered then 'Section' can
be set to lower case, which remains lower case in details. I think this is
not important since submission process picks section?

[mjg] not sure...

.          'Matches in this contest' UTC is 'right justified' - if you
double click size it then look for a match then no time info is displayed.
If you resize with matches displayed then slight overlap.

[mjg] Actually LEFT justified, but first column of a tree is a bit odd. Not sure
WHAT I should do if you resize a header when there is no data!

.          'Matches other contests' uses contest name, which doesn't fully
distinguish (in Christmas Cumulatives at least); better to use Minos log
file name?

.          'Matches other contests' also doesn't have time of the QSO (so
have to switch to that contest to find entry)

[mjg] I took the opinion that it was wasted space when the contest was past
but yes, in Xmas cums it is relevant

.          Matches in CSL selector bar is initial grey, turns blue once you
click on an entry

[mjg] Usual Windows - selected control gets a different colour 

.          "If the contest band is entered as 50 MHz  then the locator
calculator will work out the closest point for a 4 figure locator  e.g.
JO88." Don't think this is still true, not least because calculations not
done until full 6 characters entered!

[mjg] on the contest details set "Allow 4 figure locators"

.          If hit CR with blank locator then calculator wipes the other
formats, so you CAN'T use it to convert e.g. NGR to locator.

[mjg] Oh yes you can :) go to NGR, enter an NGR and hit return - which is I 
think how you would usually do it

.          Catch-up: What are Insert Before and Insert After ACTUALLY meant
to do?

[mjg] What they say - insert a new contact either before this one or after 
this one. Useful when you have messed it all up!

.          Catch-up: Managed to produce programme crash by entering QSO
1,2,6 - yes to create missing (created order looks odd); then click Insert
Before; could not edit sequence number sent; click Force.

[mjg] need to look at this one

.          Locator Calculator can also be invoked from the LOG/Force of e.g.
a duplicate. Is this intentional, or a left-over?

[mjg] Intentional - allows calculation of distance when station doesn't know locator

.          Got another programme crash closing multiple tabs from Christmas
Cumulatives. Possibly something to do with having matches open - continuing
to investigate.

[mjg] please do; these are buggers to reproduce when they happen.

.          Beware right click on non-selected (red) contest tab; actions
apply to red tab, not the 'blue' one (the one which the right-click was on).
Don't know that can do anything other than warn people? (It's what caught me
on a couple of 'faults' that weren't actually there!)

[mjg] in Minos 1, I selected the tab on right click; I'll have to look as it
periodically annoys me to
==================================================================    
To be tested
------------

Archive list editting
fractional minutes in stats display 
LatLong tool

To be completed
---------------

Sessions 
Rclick on tab dosn't select it before menu shown
Combo box of contest tabs, to allow choice of which one
mqt - no fly by hints

Nice to have
------------

Add suggested filename change to old Minos

Remove (old) .gjv format - and .log?
Add cabrillo import/export
Tab drag/drop: Tab drag would be nice as well
Facility to defeat fly by hints? Maybe use status bar instead (which is where they will be on Qt)?
Time offset to a contest (Bob Offer's problem)) - to be applied post contest; not a a clock offset

==================================================================
Break lat/long up into multiple edits (YMC)
allow decimal lat/long             
Need to break up single latlong field into deg/mins/secs
Plus EW and NS check boxes - but allow negative degrees, or E/W/N/S texts
On exit logic has to change as latlong will normally take several steps to complete
===========================================================================
Rethink logSequence and nextBlock; nextBlock is a hangover from the "old" logger.
We should just need to use logSequence, and maintain a "max" value for it.
Then cancelled catch ups wouldn't keep incrementing it.
==================================================================    
==================================================================    
Programs

Rig control
Voice keyer (Linux)
Band map
Rotator control of Spid
Qs1R control via Minos (currently stand alone)
==================================================================
Need a "snagging list" - such things as 
- "ops list" rows in details aren't RO (or at least don't show as such)
- .Minos - or is it .minos?
==================================================================    
Sorting of contest tabs- by name/start date/band/???
==================================================================    
==================================================================    
Instead of "non scoring" have "not complete" and "dup" (need better words
 - may be used for backpackers as well)
==================================================================    
                              
Please is it possible to inhibit the appearance of a readability of 5 in 
both sent and received RST. This a real pain as many contacts on UHF are 
very weak and are not readability 5
==================================================================    
Use of Qt style sheets for shapes, sizes, colours
==================================================================    
Google My Maps now accepts CSV files as input and these are probably
more flexible and useful than KML,  It would be nice if Minos was
able to export QSOs as CSVs, including lat/lon so they can be both
easily imported into My Maps and also easily edited and maybe analysed
by spreadsheet
==============================================================================
> I was also going to raise an issue regarding catch up mode and ask if it is
> possible to make the archive files active when working in catch up mode.
==================================================================
==================================================================
Button(?) on details for export
==================================================================
==================================================================
Display of operating time within the contest; may need to make the "1 hour" configurable
==================================================================
Multi band logs
run/S&P switching
==================================================================
Try a proper locator map
  Scaleable; change granularity with scale; IO/IO80/IO80ST
  Colour loc squares on map for number of contacts
  Able to select by country?
  How do we get a usable map? Or can we leverage google and embed the map?
  If we don't have a map is a splatter diagram still meaningul?
  Or can we get a crude "loc squares" map 
==================================================================
Changes to do

G4DDN - editing of archive list leads to crash
Odd crashes in lists; do I have a stack trace in the logs? Although that was on Grahams's laptop.
                                   
Control key map tables to allow reassignment
Rig control - Omnirig is probably adequate (but not on Linux!)
Rotator control (don't think Omnirig does this, may need own code?)
Voice keyer, calling freqs, etc
Can we eliminate the voice keyer whistle? I think it is system/hardware, not software
Disable F keys configurably (to allow voice keyer to run as well) (Qt?)
We want an option(options?) to control visibility in a KML export
Better header text for loc/distance in country and district display

And eventually, get back into networking
And HF? How do we go about cabrillo export in general?
==================================================================
Double click on contest in Vista default directory says "already open"?
Well, it will if it is in the pre-load list!
==================================================================
?? Have profile flags to say "don't display if at default"/"don't (re)write default key/value"
?? Indicate default/non default in editor
allow tab between keys in editor! Maybe redo as an editable string grid?
==================================================================
Make sure use of MinosLogger.ini is documented! Will be VERY useful
on Vista/Windows 7 (but test it...)
e.g.
[Default]
Log Directory=c:\temp
===========================================================================
===========================================================================
//================================================================
Bugs, etc to fix
=================

Sticky splitters in monitor and chat

Auto copy MinosLines on compilation

SysMenu - bring main window back to screen centre

fly-by hints for headers

auto width on headers

Sorting and column rearrangement, especially on match lists?

sticky header drag/drop

clear down of sticky settings

sticky stats splitter(s)

Add colour attribute to bandlist.xml, use it in the band combo

Revise networking to use something like activeMQ topics

revise networking to use something like activeMQ clustering
