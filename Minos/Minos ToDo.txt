2010 calendar; make URLs for years configurable; make a new year just a config change!

//================================================================
Bugs, etc to fix
=================
	

Sticky splitters in monitor and chat

Auto copy MinosLines on compilation

Some form of log printing? 

Insert before/insert after; "easy" enough to do, but what needs doing to all following? Do we need bulk increment of serial numbers? Or do we want a multi-select that allows such things?

//================================================================
Next version - 1.4.0.0

Event message modifications - big change, but should be nothing visible

Dble click on QSO in "other" grid does transfer

F12 does transfer

RMB option for editting "other" grid contact

Operator setting moved from ops frame to main screen or contest details screen.

Sticky "show operators" on RMB for main screen

Station call is the default initial operator

Post event and Uri mode simplification - catch-up button and unfilled button on QSO edit area. Uri mode still not that obvious to initiate

Scrolling tabs as an option, on RMB

Read only simplification - or for now, don't allow it  to be set

//================================================================
Next version - 1.3.1 Beta - new features etc

Using a branch "svn+ssh://g0gjv@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/minos/branches/V1_3_1_x"

//================================================================
Next version - 1.3.0 - new features etc

Duplicate bug when coming off the QSO Edit dialog

Uses rsgbcc URL for contest files

"time now" button/accelerator

"mode change" button/accelerator

Revise display of current band; above cribsheet looks good;

Locators - if replacing 1/I and 0/O makes a good locator then do it!

Mults don't get reset when choosing from calendar

New style splitters, all should be sticky

New style calendar

Reduced number of support files (so hopefully all smaller)

//==================================================================
*****************  Documentation for networking  *******************
//==================================================================
Use RSGB addresses for calendar; slide calendars looked for based on current date (don't get before previous november?)

Make calendar URLs configurable (somewhere - registry? Probably not! But need an editor for them - button on TCalendarForm?)

Can we make "old" contests read only? i.e. if "after time" by some amount then make them RO unless overridden? Lose the RO check box!

Insert contact(s) before(/after?), with option to renumber following up to an unfilled contact

?? free floating crib sheet

SysMenu - bring main window back to screen centre

fly-by hints for headers

auto width on headers

Sorting and column rearrangement, especially on match lists?

sticky header drag/drop

clear down of sticky settings

sticky stats splitter(s)

Add colour attribute to bandlist.xml, use it in the band combo

Revise networking to use something like activeMQ topics

revise networking to use something like activeMQ clustering

?? revise to use attached forms (with actions) rather than the current mess of frames?
