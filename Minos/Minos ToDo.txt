2010 calendar; make URLs for years configurable; make a new year just a config change!

//================================================================
Bugs, etc to fix

Ken's duplicate bug

Sticky splitters in monitor and chat

Remove spinners from keyer - use sliders?

Check tab orders (again) - to make sure!

What to do with spare space in log details?

Auto copy MinosLines on compilation

Can we get nice direction arrows on the splitters, or are the dots enough?
//================================================================
Next version - 1.3.0 - new features etc

Uses rsgbcc URL for contest files

"time now" button/accelerator

"mode change" button/accelerator

Revise display of current band; above cribsheet looks good;

Locators - if replacing 1/I and 0/O makes a good locator then do it!

Mults don't get reset when choosing from calendar

New style splitters, all should be sticky

New style calendar

Reduced number of support files (so hopefully all smaller)

//==================================================================
Use RSGB addresses for calendar; slide calendars looked for based on current date (don't get before previous november?)

Make calendar URLs configurable (somewhere - registry? Probably not! But need an editor for them - button on TCalendarForm?)

Dble click on QSO in other switches contests, not transfer - need RMB for switch/edit

Merge post entry and Uri mode (somehow) - Double click on "next" contact to trigger fill in

Can we make "old" contests read only? i.e. if "after time" by some amount then make them RO unless overridden? Lose the RO check box!

Insert contact(s) before(/after?), with option to renumber following up to an unfilled contact

?? free floating crib sheet

SysMenu - bring main window back to screen centre

Make archive splitters sticky

fly-by hints for headers

auto width on headers

Sorting and column rearrangement, especially on match lists?

sticky header drag/drop

sticky settings clear down

sticky stats splitter(s)

Add colour attribute to bandlist.xml, use it in the band combo
