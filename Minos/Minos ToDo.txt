V1.5 Release notes

2011 calendar
Date format forced so it will work as UK dates no matter what the OS thinks
Date and Time taken at end of QSO (not at the start as previously); remove "date now"
Prettification of bundles
Operator combos are now larger
Add next/prior, but no consequential bulk changes
Catchup and serial numbers - bug fix
Archive display - bug fix
HF style prefix handling
===========================================================================
Archive list display - showed G4DDN| IO91PK | RG | RG(20) for G4DDN, IO91PK, RG, 20
===========================================================================
M0XDF running under Wine:
I've just confirmed what I suspected last month.
When you create a contest and pick 03-Aug-10 and fill in the details, 
and click ok (or is it close), the save as pop appears and gives a 
default file name of G6BRA_2010Mar08_145 MHz.minos
===========================================================================
Enter one contact, then go to catch up - no operator carried in
===========================================================================

Opening out contacts:
	Post Entry doesn't notice, doesn't ask
	And when you drop back, the serial is back where it was
	And if you then open out contacts you get the same serial in twice
	And should you be able to NOT open out contacts (so you don't get a set of dead contacts when you aren't going to fill in)? 
	Can we use a single dialog box somehow?
===========================================================================
It looks as though KZ has never been recognised as a US callsign (GJV-E has
the same issue), and hence not as a DXCC multiplier.

To quote from the A1CG guys who were actually out last weekend (I wasn't):

  We worked KZ4RR in Florida in the recent 50 MHz trophy
contest but Minos did not recognise this as a country.  It recognised
  NP3CW in Puerto Rica, who we also worked, and it recognises
K but not KZ.

Presumably it is just a table configuration issue?
===========================================================================
Facility to defeat fly by hints? Maybe us status bar instead (which is where they will be on Qt)?
===========================================================================
(done)
Right justify the bundle labels, so they come "close" to the bundle combos. Maybe put frames round them as well?

===========================================================================
Rethink logSequence and nextBlock; nextBlock is a hangover from the "old" logger.
We should just need to use logSequence, and maintain a "max" value for it.
Then cancelled catch ups wouldn't keep incrementing it.
===========================================================================
1.4 release notes

Read only now becomes "protected" and is stored properly with the contest. It can be temporarily lifted so that back editting can be done. For now, you have to set it manually; I may in future make it automatically set on producing the entry or after the entry date has passed. What do the users think?

Tab highlighting is more prominent with tab colours - a darkish blue for normal contests, darkish green for protected contests, bright green for protected contests that are temporarily unprotected, bright blue for the current contest

Operator setting moved from ops frame to main screen or contest details screen, and I hope it all works again.

Sticky "show operators" on Right Mouse Button for main screen

Station call is the default initial operator

Dble click on QSO in "other" grid does transfer, not edit; Right Mouse Button option for editting "other" grid contact

Post event and unfilled QSO simplification - catch-up button and unfilled button on QSO edit area.

Scrolling tabs as an option, on Right Mouse Button. This makes all the tabs form a single line at the top, with scroll arrows, rather than multiple lines.

New printable output format on Produce Entry/export file

EDI export entry keeps the file name - robot will sort it out if not to standards.

Bug fixes

===========================================================================
VK9AA comes out against VK9N, when he should be in VK9C
===========================================================================
We DEFINITELY need a colour choice dialog...
	live contest
	current active contest
	protected contest
	protected suppressed contest
	QSO editted
	QSO forced
	splitter flyover
	splitter
	focussed control label
	outside contest DTG
	band combo
	new mult
	hints
	match Xfer and match xfer selected
	And probably others...
	
And the holy grail - font choice! Can we do this globally? Doubt it without self sizing controls (wait for Qt!).
===========================================================================
Thanks for the new version Mike

Here is my first pass; obviously I will not start on documentation until (at least) we have a stable version.

4.      The sticky panel settings have a number of problems:

a.      Stats panel only consistent once ‘activated’ for a given open contest (may be intentional?)

b.      Stats settings not retained across close/re-open

c.      Worked/unworked sub-panel positioning not consistent; tick boxes are (maybe don’t want them to be?)

d.      Width of CSL panel consistent across contests; width of internal columns not retained. Appears to be same on ‘other’ panel.

e.       retained


5.      (Correct - it applies to all relevant stats tabs)On the stats/locators panel, ‘unworked only’ doesn’t seem to do anything (this is not new on this version). Did it ever do anything (I think I remember that it did once)? If it only applies to districts then the tick box should be hidden for locators.

===========================================================================

Since I have been using Minos in the Xmas cumulatives I have noticed that each time you save an entry it defaults to the \minos\logs folder, rather than retaining the default of the last one used. (I file submitted logs elsewhere).
===========================================================================
Make URLs for years configurable; make a new year just a config change!

//================================================================
Bugs, etc to fix
=================
Look at stickiness of stats panel splitters

Sticky splitters in monitor and chat

Auto copy MinosLines on compilation

Insert before/insert after; "easy" enough to do, but what needs doing to all following? Do we need bulk increment of serial numbers? Or do we want a multi-select that allows such things?

//================================================================
Next version - 1.4.0.0

Event message modifications - big change, but should be nothing visible (except bugs)

Read only now becomes "protected" and is stored properly with the contest. It can be temporarily lifted so that back editting can be done. For now, you have to set it manually; may in future make it automatically set on producing the entry or after the entry date has passed. What do the users think?

*** Are tab colours new to the public in this release? YES! so we need a bit more explanation ***
Tab highlight more prominent; different colours for different states.

Post event and Uri mode simplification - catch-up button and unfilled button on QSO edit area. Uri mode still not that obvious to initiate

Operator setting moved from ops frame to main screen or contest details screen.

Sticky "show operators" on RMB for main screen

Station call is the default initial operator

Scrolling tabs as an option, on RMB. This makes all the tabs form a single line at the top, with scroll arrows, rather than multiple lines.

New printable output format on Produce Entry/export file; Does this do what people want?

F12 does match transfer from the entry highlighted in pink

EDI export entry keeps file name - robot will sort it out.

Most splitters etc sticky cross contest

Dble click on QSO in "other" grid does transfer, not edit; RMB option for editting "other" grid contact


//================================================================
Next version - 1.3.1 Beta - new features etc

Using a branch "svn+ssh://g0gjv@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/minos/branches/V1_3_1_x"

//================================================================
Next version - 1.3.0 - new features etc

1.3.0.165

Duplicate bug when coming off the QSO Edit dialog

Uses rsgbcc URL for contest files

"time now" button/accelerator

"mode change" button/accelerator

Revise display of current band; above cribsheet looks good;

Locators - if replacing 1/I and 0/O makes a good locator then do it!

Mults don't get reset when choosing from calendar

New style splitters, all should be sticky

New style calendar

Reduced number of support files (so hopefully all smaller)

//==================================================================
*****************  Documentation for networking  *******************
//==================================================================
Use RSGB addresses for calendar; slide calendars looked for based on current date (don't get before previous november?)

Make calendar URLs configurable (somewhere - registry? Probably not! But need an editor for them - button on TCalendarForm?)

Can we make "old" contests read only? i.e. if "after time" by some amount then make them RO unless overridden? Lose the RO check box!

Insert contact(s) before(/after?), with option to renumber following up to an unfilled contact

?? free floating crib sheet

SysMenu - bring main window back to screen centre

fly-by hints for headers

auto width on headers

Sorting and column rearrangement, especially on match lists?

sticky header drag/drop

clear down of sticky settings

sticky stats splitter(s)

Add colour attribute to bandlist.xml, use it in the band combo

Revise networking to use something like activeMQ topics

revise networking to use something like activeMQ clustering

?? revise to use attached forms (with actions) rather than the current mess of frames?
