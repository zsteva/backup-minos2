2010 calendar; make URLs for years configurable; make a new year just a config change!

//================================================================
Bugs, etc to fix

OPERATORS: 
	we need to assume station callsign is initial op; 
	we don't need to worry about "old" contests; 
	edit last contact needs to modify the current op
	How much testing can we do?
	
	?? add contest * (or void *?) to all send events
	so we have something better to check than isCurrentLog
	
	Add op to "must fill" list (but preset to station call)
	Force caps on contest details ops
	And it doesn't propagate into contest proper
	
	Ops transfer to contest entry? But don't overwrite what the user enters!
	
	Use a combo for the current/second op, on main dialog
	
	?? change some of the colours to make it more interesting (e.g. the Op1: label)
	
Scrolling tabs as an option

Use RSGB addresses for calendar; slide calendars looked for based on current date (don't get before previous november?)

Make calendar URLs configurable (somewhere - registry? Probably not! But need an editor for them - button on TCalendarForm?)

Can we make "old" contests read only? i.e. if "after time" by some amount then make them RO unless overridden? Lose the RO check box!

Insert contact(s) before(/after?), with option to renumber following up to an unfilled contact

?? free floating crib sheet

SysMenu - bring main window back to screen centre

Add colour attribute to bandlist.xml, use it in the band combo

Revise networking to use something like activeMQ topics

revise networking to use something like activeMQ clustering
