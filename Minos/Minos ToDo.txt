I need an SDR mute application, linked to PTT out. Is the first "non local" minos app, or does it make use of remote access to the SDR server?

Read Only

Write an "Entry generated" record to the log whe the EDI is produced; then switch to RO. Also make RO once the entry date has passed. Allow the operator to set "log complete", and act effectively as entry produced. 

Then it loads and automatically goes RO, and closes the file. Could do with a separate RO list (or an RO modifier) to open on restart.

Have a new menu entry, open completed log for edit - needs to close the existing RO log (if any) and then open it in NOT RO mode. Once closed again (or on restart) it DOES NOT persist open.

Hi Mike,

Since I have been using Minos in the Xmas cumulatives I have noticed that each time you save an entry it defaults to the \minos\logs folder, rather than retaining the default of the last one used. (I file submitted logs elsewhere).

The ‘band in use’ marker has improved multi-band operation, but it occurred to me that perhaps there would be added advantage from highlighting/colouring the selected tab that is in use?


We have had previous discussions about the stats and duplicates displays; not only do they lose their settings on each invocation they have different settings for each contest that is open. I would view these as constants across all invocations, like overall windows size – what say?

2010 calendar; make URLs for years configurable; make a new year just a config change!

//================================================================
Bugs, etc to fix
=================
	

Sticky splitters in monitor and chat

Auto copy MinosLines on compilation

Insert before/insert after; "easy" enough to do, but what needs doing to all following? Do we need bulk increment of serial numbers? Or do we want a multi-select that allows such things?

//================================================================
Next version - 1.4.0.0

Event message modifications - big change, but should be nothing visible

Dble click on QSO in "other" grid does transfer

F12 does transfer

RMB option for editting "other" grid contact

Operator setting moved from ops frame to main screen or contest details screen.

Sticky "show operators" on RMB for main screen

Station call is the default initial operator

Post event and Uri mode simplification - catch-up button and unfilled button on QSO edit area. Uri mode still not that obvious to initiate

Scrolling tabs as an option, on RMB

Read only simplification - or for now, don't allow it  to be set

New printable output format on Produce Entry/export file
//================================================================
Next version - 1.3.1 Beta - new features etc

Using a branch "svn+ssh://g0gjv@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/minos/branches/V1_3_1_x"

//================================================================
Next version - 1.3.0 - new features etc

Duplicate bug when coming off the QSO Edit dialog

Uses rsgbcc URL for contest files

"time now" button/accelerator

"mode change" button/accelerator

Revise display of current band; above cribsheet looks good;

Locators - if replacing 1/I and 0/O makes a good locator then do it!

Mults don't get reset when choosing from calendar

New style splitters, all should be sticky

New style calendar

Reduced number of support files (so hopefully all smaller)

//==================================================================
*****************  Documentation for networking  *******************
//==================================================================
Use RSGB addresses for calendar; slide calendars looked for based on current date (don't get before previous november?)

Make calendar URLs configurable (somewhere - registry? Probably not! But need an editor for them - button on TCalendarForm?)

Can we make "old" contests read only? i.e. if "after time" by some amount then make them RO unless overridden? Lose the RO check box!

Insert contact(s) before(/after?), with option to renumber following up to an unfilled contact

?? free floating crib sheet

SysMenu - bring main window back to screen centre

fly-by hints for headers

auto width on headers

Sorting and column rearrangement, especially on match lists?

sticky header drag/drop

clear down of sticky settings

sticky stats splitter(s)

Add colour attribute to bandlist.xml, use it in the band combo

Revise networking to use something like activeMQ topics

revise networking to use something like activeMQ clustering

?? revise to use attached forms (with actions) rather than the current mess of frames?
