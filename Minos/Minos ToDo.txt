We DEFINITELY need a colour choice dialog...
	live contest
	current active contest
	protected contest
	protected suppressed contest
	QSO editted
	QSO forced
	splitter flyover
	splitter
	focussed control label
	outside contest DTG
	band combo
	new mult
	hints
	match Xfer and match xfer selected
	And probably others...
	
And the holy grail - font choice! Can we do this globally? Doubt it without self sizing controls (wait for Qt!).

done Right click/contest details on a tab doesn't show the correct contest - seen when trying to protect old contests
done Need and on tab indication of protected contests - a different colour? Dark grey perhaps; maybe bracket the name. Plus need an indication of temp unprotected.
===========================================================================
done Text on calendar screen buttons overflows -presumably following font regularisation
===========================================================================
Thanks for the new version Mike

Here is my first pass; obviously I will not start on documentation until (at least) we have a stable version.

1.      ( <g> )Tab highlight is excellent, although I am not sure I would have chosen that colour J

2.      (done) Swapping between contests causes a loss of any partial data entered.

3.      (fixed, I hope - silly bug)Double click on CSL for transfer is not working properly (haven’t tried it for ‘other’):

a.      First single click to select an entry returns to first with none highlighted

b.      Double click does not fill QSO; behaviour depends on which of list (of four in my test) is selected:

i.      First does nothing as far as I can see; leaves pink bar on first

ii.     Intermediate does nothing; leaves blue bar on first

iii.    Last enters details of first to QSO; leaves ONLY that first entry, highlighted in pink.

iv.     The above behaviours do not seem to be consistent; they seem to depend on the interval between clicks.


4.      The sticky panel settings have a number of problems:

a.      Stats panel only consistent once ‘activated’ for a given open contest (may be intentional?)

b.      Stats settings not retained across close/re-open

c.      Worked/unworked sub-panel positioning not consistent; tick boxes are (maybe don’t want them to be?)

d.      Width of CSL panel consistent across contests; width of internal columns not retained. Appears to be same on ‘other’ panel.

e.       retained


5.      (Correct - it applies to all relevant stats tabs)On the stats/locators panel, ‘unworked only’ doesn’t seem to do anything (this is not new on this version). Did it ever do anything (I think I remember that it did once)? If it only applies to districts then the tick box should be hidden for locators.

6.      On VHF calendar download:

a.      (done)Text doesn’t fit on buttons (and file version)

b.      (???) Panel doesn’t show all content within default width

c.      (years should be present if they haven't been deleted)‘Fast forward’ to non-loaded year gives ‘failed to load’ but changes year display (maybe correct?)


7.      (done)Reg1test format does not generate full filename, others (not sure if all) do.

8.      (Some changes made; why dd-mmm-(yy)yy? Not a normal UK date format) New printed format is good, but date format should be dd-mmm-(yy)yy in my view.

9.      (Probably! Nasty area)I think there are some inconsistencies between 432 and 435 MHz, but I have not managed to pin them down.

10.     (no but...)Latest calendar goes to 2012; is that ‘safe’?

11.     (What did you think it meant?)RMB edit didn’t do what I thought it meant – will have to document this carefully J

12.     (explain)Not clear to me what scrolling tabs does (maybe not enough data in my test contests?)


13.     Cryptic notes for my benefit only (when trying to reproduce a possible problem with catch-up/after event):

a.      Maybe depends on post entry rather than current time

b.      Enter 2, leaves serial at 1

c.      1,2 set to 5 creates 4,5, but not 3 then next went to 6

d.      Re-entered 3,4, went to end (4 dupe)

e.      Time handling (and date (use previous)

f.      Define op


14.     Read only behaviour.

a.      If automatically make RO when EDI file produced then a bit of a problem for re-work (although the file/override probably covers it). Probably requires a confirmation or a deliberate ‘do not RO’?

b.      If RO is a selected option or can be disabled what if user doesn’t do it – leave them to their own devices I assume?

c.      Certainly beyond entry date seems good; will make file RO be an option in Minos (on file menu)?

d.      Call it ‘protect’ or ‘archive’ rather than RO?
===========================================================================

I need an SDR mute application, linked to PTT out. Is the first "non local" minos app, or does it make use of remote access to the SDR server?
===========================================================================
Read Only

Write an "Entry generated" record to the log whe the EDI is produced; then switch to RO. Also make RO once the entry date has passed. Also allow the operator to set "log complete", and act effectively as entry produced. 

Then it loads and automatically goes RO, and closes the file. Could do with a separate RO list (or an RO modifier) to open on restart.

Have a new menu entry, open completed log for edit - needs to close the existing RO log (if any) and then open it in NOT RO mode. Once closed again (or on restart) it DOES NOT persist open.


*** Add a "suppress read only" flag; if we always use "isReadOnly()" then should be OK. Use an event to switch TO RO. Suppress RO needs to be set very early, to allow contest to be opened in correct mode.

Call it "protected" rather than RO. How do we manage to detect Protected contests in a file open dialog? Can we? Or do we just have the one "open" and an option to temporarily unprotect (I think this is what we will have to do)?

===========================================================================
Hi Mike,

Since I have been using Minos in the Xmas cumulatives I have noticed that each time you save an entry it defaults to the \minos\logs folder, rather than retaining the default of the last one used. (I file submitted logs elsewhere).

Done: The ‘band in use’ marker has improved multi-band operation, but it occurred to me that perhaps there would be added advantage from highlighting/colouring the selected tab that is in use?


Maybe done? We have had previous discussions about the stats and duplicates displays; not only do they lose their settings on each invocation they have different settings for each contest that is open. I would view these as constants across all invocations, like overall windows size – what say?

===========================================================================
2010 calendar; make URLs for years configurable; make a new year just a config change!

//================================================================
Bugs, etc to fix
=================
(done) Keyboard accelerators - e.g. Alt F is "File" and "Force".

(done)Change default name for EDI files to match the minos name

Look at stickiness of stats panel splitters

Sticky splitters in monitor and chat

Auto copy MinosLines on compilation

Insert before/insert after; "easy" enough to do, but what needs doing to all following? Do we need bulk increment of serial numbers? Or do we want a multi-select that allows such things?

//================================================================
Next version - 1.4.0.0

Event message modifications - big change, but should be nothing visible (except bugs)

Tab highlight more prominent; different colours for different states.

Most splitters etc sticky cross contest

Dble click on QSO in "other" grid does transfer, not edit; RMB option for editting "other" grid contact

F12 does match transfer from the entry highlighted in pink

Operator setting moved from ops frame to main screen or contest details screen.

Sticky "show operators" on RMB for main screen

Station call is the default initial operator

Post event and Uri mode simplification - catch-up button and unfilled button on QSO edit area. Uri mode still not that obvious to initiate

Scrolling tabs as an option, on RMB. This makes all the tabs form a single line at the top, with scroll arrows, rather than multiple lines.

Read only now becomes "protected" and is stored properly with the contest. It can be temporarily lifted so that back editting can be done. For now, you have to set it manually; may in future make it automatically set on producing the entry or after the entry date has passed. What do the users think?

New printable output format on Produce Entry/export file

EDI export entry keeps file name - robot will sort it out.
//================================================================
Next version - 1.3.1 Beta - new features etc

Using a branch "svn+ssh://g0gjv@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/minos/branches/V1_3_1_x"

//================================================================
Next version - 1.3.0 - new features etc

Duplicate bug when coming off the QSO Edit dialog

Uses rsgbcc URL for contest files

"time now" button/accelerator

"mode change" button/accelerator

Revise display of current band; above cribsheet looks good;

Locators - if replacing 1/I and 0/O makes a good locator then do it!

Mults don't get reset when choosing from calendar

New style splitters, all should be sticky

New style calendar

Reduced number of support files (so hopefully all smaller)

//==================================================================
*****************  Documentation for networking  *******************
//==================================================================
Use RSGB addresses for calendar; slide calendars looked for based on current date (don't get before previous november?)

Make calendar URLs configurable (somewhere - registry? Probably not! But need an editor for them - button on TCalendarForm?)

Can we make "old" contests read only? i.e. if "after time" by some amount then make them RO unless overridden? Lose the RO check box!

Insert contact(s) before(/after?), with option to renumber following up to an unfilled contact

?? free floating crib sheet

SysMenu - bring main window back to screen centre

fly-by hints for headers

auto width on headers

Sorting and column rearrangement, especially on match lists?

sticky header drag/drop

clear down of sticky settings

sticky stats splitter(s)

Add colour attribute to bandlist.xml, use it in the band combo

Revise networking to use something like activeMQ topics

revise networking to use something like activeMQ clustering

?? revise to use attached forms (with actions) rather than the current mess of frames?
