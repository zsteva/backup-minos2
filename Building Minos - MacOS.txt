If or when you know what you are doing, a lot of this will be
overly prescriptive.

And when it comes to "installation" at the end a Linux guru will probably be 
horrified. If so, please take it over and fix it for me!

At the moment, Minos under Linux has to count as "advanced", as you do need to 
know your way around Linux. 



Building under MacOS X
======================

This is based on Xcode 9.2 on MacOS High Sierra 10.13.3 

N.B. I have build other applications using this Mac, and may have hidden pre-requisites already in place.  This is entirely an 'it worked once' installation, rather than something repeatable on any Mac you can find. 


1) Install Xcode from developer.apple.com.  You will need to register for a developer account using your apple ID.  
2) Install the HomeBrew package manager from brew.sh
	/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
3) Install dependencies:
	brew install git

4) Download Minos Source Code
	NB other scripts refer to $HOME/Minos2, so you're stuck with it. 

	cd ~
	git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/minos/minos Minos2
	cd Minos2

5) Install other required components

	./mactools.sh

4) Download RTaudio and compile (ended up not needing this, got the included RTaudio to build)

	cd <somwhere that works for you>
	wget http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtaudio/release/rtaudio-5.0.0.tar.gz
	tar xfz rtaudio-5.0.0.tar.gz
	cd rtaudio-5.0.0
	configure && make
	sudo make install

5) There is no step 5. 

6) Modify buildInstall.sh changing
	cp ~/Minos2/build/MqtAppStarter/MqtAppStarter Bin
to
	cp -r ~/Minos2/build/MqtAppStarter/MqtAppStarter.app Bin
for each app.

7) You should now be able to go ahead with the build.

	export PATH="/usr/local/opt/qt/bin:$PATH"
	cd mqt/Installer
	./buildInstall.sh

8) And then run it with
	open -a ~/minos-runtime/MqtLogger.app

To update and buid again, repeat from after "git clone"
