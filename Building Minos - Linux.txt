If or when you know what you are doing, a lot of this will be
overly prescriptive.

And when it comes to "installation" at the end a Linux guru will probably be 
horrified. If so, please take it over and fix it for me!

At the moment, Minos under Linux has to count as "advanced", as you do need to 
know your way around Linux. 

Building under Linux
====================

Currently, these instructions work under Ubuntu, and also on the Raspberry Pi
where the default oS is similar enough to Ubuntu. There shouldn't be any
problem with other variants, but all the package stuff may be different.


sudo apt-get install git


Go to your home directory and check out Minos


git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/minos/minos Minos2

If git isn't installed, you need to install it:

then you need to make sure all the pre-requesites are installed:

cd Minos2
sudo ./tools.sh 

Run QtCreator using

qtcreator

Open ~/Minos2/mqt/mqt.pro; first time you may need to configure it - everything 
should be set up, just hit "Configure Project".

Choose Qt 5.6.2, "Release"

Build - the hammer icon at bottom left. This should run to completion, with a 
few warnings. On a Pi, this will take literally hours, so be warned.

To get a runnable system, run ~/Minos2/mqt/Installer/buildInstall.sh

which will put a runnable system into ~/minos-runtime.

To run it, from the command line type

~/minos-runtime/Minos.sh &
