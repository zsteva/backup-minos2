If or when you know what you are doing, a lot of this will be
overly prescriptive.

Building under Windows
======================

Create a master directory - I use C:\projects

c:
cd \
mkdir projects
cd projects

Install git; I use a GUI tool TortoiseGit from

https://tortoisegit.org/

This also requires a command line git from https://git-for-windows.github.io/

There are other distributions and tools that can be used.

Check out Minos:

git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/minos/minos minos2

Install hamlib from https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib/ into a directory under C:\projects`
(it has to be in the correct position relative to Minos, or the build won't find the corect files).

 
To get Qt, go to

https://www1.qt.io/download-open-source

and click "Download now"; this gets you the "online installer", which is a small program that manages
the rest of the download. using this also sets up the Qt Maintenance tool, which makes subsequent
updates of Qt and its tools far easier.  It also installs icons for the main tools.

Click through until it updates its meta information, then under "select components" choose the required components

Get 5.6.3 (which we need to stay compatible with for Linux); under "tools" make sure that MinGW 4.9.2 is ticked. 
If you want to do any debugging, you also need the "Qt Creator CDB Debugger".

Using MSVC and/or more recent Qt versions counts as an "advanced" option, but is quite possible.

If you aren't going to be running under QT Creator then you will need to add the Qt bin directory to your path; something like

path C:\Qt\Qt5.6.3\Tools\mingw492_32\bin;%path% 

is required. I use an excellent tool called the "Rapid Environment Editor" from 
https://www.rapidee.com to manage this and other environment variables.

Run QtCreator

Open C:\Projects\Minos2\mqt\mqt.pro; first time will need to configure it. It will
automatically bring up a dialog to let you do this.

Choose Qt 5.6.2, "Release" Build - the hammer icon at bottom left. This should run to completion, 
with a few warnings.

To get a runnable system, install wget and Inno Setup:

wget - https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/

(I use the 32 bit binary on a 64 bit system)

Inno Setup - http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
 
Then

cd C:\Projects\minos2\mqt\Installer

and run

buildInstall.bat

and you will find a runnable system installed in 

C:\temp\mqtInstaller\installFiles

which you can copy to wherever you wish to run from. To change the way this works, 
copy buildInstall.bat to another filename, and edit as you wish.

To set up an icon for the logger, the logger executable is

 C:\temp\mqtInstaller\installFiles\Bin\MqtLogger.exe, 

and you need to modify the "start in" directory to be C:\temp\mqtInstaller\installFiles 

(leaving off the "\Bin" of the executable).

If you wish to debug (advanced!), then you need to build as "Debug", and set the working directory for running
under the debugger as for the icon above.
