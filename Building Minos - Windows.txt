If or when you know what you are doing, a lot of this will be
overly prescriptive.

Building under Windows
======================

Create a master directory - I use C:\projects

c:
cd \
mkdir projects
cd projects

Check out Minos

git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/minos/minos minos2

Install hamlib from https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib/ into a directory under C:\projects`
(it has to be in the correct position relative to Minos, or the build won't find the corect files).

Install qt - get either 5.6.2 (which we need to stay compatible with for Linux); under "tools" make
 sure that MinGW 4.9.2 is ticked. 

Using MSVC and/or more recent Qt versions counts as an "advanced" option, but is quite possible.

Run QtCreator

Open C:\Projects\Minos2\mqt\mqt.pro; first time you may need to configure it.

Choose Qt 5.6.2, "Release"

Build - the hammer icon at bottom left. This should run to completion, with a few warnings.

To get a runnable system, 

cd C:\Projects\minos2\mqt\Installer

and run

buildInstall.bat

This will fail near the end unless you have wget and Inno Setup installed

wget - https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/

Inno Setup - http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
 
(only needed if you want to build an installer), but you will find a runnable system
installed in 

C:\temp\mqtInstaller\installFiles

which you can copy to wherever you wish to run from. To change the way this works, 
copy buildInstall.bat to another filename, and edit as you wish.

To set up an icon for the logger, the logger executable is

 C:\temp\mqtInstaller\installFiles\Bin\MqtLogger.exe, 

and you need to modify the "start in" directory to be C:\temp\mqtInstaller\installFiles 

(leaving off the "\Bin" of the executable).

If you wish to debug (advanced!), then you need to build as "Debug", and set the working directory for running
under the debugger as for the icon above.
