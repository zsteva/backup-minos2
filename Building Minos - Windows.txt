If or when you know what you are doing, a lot of this will be
overly prescriptive.

And if you wish to take an active part in development then a more detailed
understanding of the build process will be required.

Building under Windows
======================

Install git from https://git-for-windows.github.io/

(There are other distributions and tools that can be used.)

Create a master directory - I use C:\projects

c:
cd \
mkdir projects
cd projects

Check out Minos:

git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/minos/minos Minos2

Install hamlib from https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib/ into a directory under C:\projects`
(it has to be in the correct position relative to Minos, or the build won't find the corect files).

 
To get Qt, go to (NB This really needs some pictures!)

https://www1.qt.io/download-open-source

and click "Download now"; this gets you the "online installer", which is a small program that manages
the rest of the download. using this also sets up the Qt Maintenance tool, which makes subsequent
updates of Qt and its tools far easier.  It also installs icons for the main tools.

Let Qt install into its "natural" home c:\Qt

Click through until it updates its meta information, then under "select components" choose the required components

Get Qt version 5.9.2 ; under "tools" make sure that MinGW 5.3.0 is ticked. 

Using MSVC and/or more recent Qt versions counts as an "advanced" option, but is quite possible.

Install wget and Inno Setup:

wget - https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/

(I use the 32 bit binary on a 64 bit system)

Inno Setup - http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
 
Then to fetch and build the current "bleeding edge" of the project (which will usually be safe to run,
but may contain unfinished facilities)

C:\Projects\Minos2\mqt\Installer\buildInstall.bat

and you will find a runnable system installed in 

C:\Projects\Minos2\mqtInstaller\installFiles

which you can copy to wherever you wish to run from. To change the way this works, 
copy buildInstall.bat to another filename, and edit as you wish.

To set up an icon for the logger, the logger executable is

 C:\temp\mqtInstaller\installFiles\Bin\MqtLogger.exe, 

and you need to modify the "start in" directory to be C:\temp\mqtInstaller\installFiles 

(leaving off the "\Bin" of the executable).

If you wish to debug (advanced!), then you need to build as "Debug", and set the working directory for running
under the debugger as for the icon above.

Having built once, if you wish to "catch up" with the current bleeding edge state of the project, run

C:\Projects\Minos2\mqt\Installer\buildInstall.bat

again.
